![Pytrovich](pytrovich.png)
==========================================

__pytrovich__ is a Python 3.6+ port of [petrovich library](https://github.com/petrovich) which inflects Russian names 
to a given grammatical case. It supports first names, last names and middle names inflections. Since version 0.0.2,
gender detection is also available. 

[petrovich-java](https://github.com/petrovich/petrovich-java) was the main inspiration.

The alternative (earlier) port: [Petrovich](https://github.com/damirazo/Petrovich)  
([@alexeyev](https://github.com/alexeyev) was not aware of it at the time of porting `petrovich` to Python). 
The only meaningful difference we have found is that it does not support gender detection.

## Installation
Should be as simple as that
```bash
pip install pytrovich
```

## Usage

```python
from pytrovich.enums import NamePart, Gender, Case
from pytrovich.maker import PetrovichDeclinationMaker

maker = PetrovichDeclinationMaker()
print(maker.make(NamePart.FIRSTNAME, Gender.MALE, Case.GENITIVE, "Иван"))  # Ивана
print(maker.make(NamePart.LASTNAME, Gender.MALE, Case.INSTRUMENTAL, "Иванов"))  # Ивановым
print(maker.make(NamePart.MIDDLENAME, Gender.FEMALE, Case.DATIVE, "Ивановна"))  # Ивановне
```


```python 
from pytrovich.detector import PetrovichGenderDetector

detector = PetrovichGenderDetector()
print(detector.detect(firstname="Иван"))  # Gender.MALE
print(detector.detect(firstname="Иван", middlename="Семёнович"))  # Gender.MALE
print(detector.detect(firstname="Арзу", middlename="Лутфияр кызы"))  # Gender.FEMALE
```


### Custom rule file

You can replace default rules file with some custom one. Only JSON format is supported.
```python
maker = PetrovichDeclinationMaker("/path/to/custom/rules.file.json")
```
E.g. if `pytrovich` fails on `PetrovichDeclinationMaker` creation, 
one may consider downloading `rules.json` directly from 
[petrovich-rules repo](https://github.com/petrovich/petrovich-rules) as a fix (please create an issue if that actually happens).

### How to cite

Not neccessary, but greatly appreciated, if you use this work.

```latex
@misc{Pytrovich,
  title     = {{petrovich/pytrovich: Python3 port of Petrovich, an inflector for Russian anthroponyms}},
  year      = {2020},

}
```

### More info

For more information on the project please refer to other [petrovich](https://github.com/petrovich/) repos.

### TODO

- efficiency was not a top priority, the time has come for faster algorithms, RegEx and data structures
- evaluation based on [petrovich-eval](https://github.com/petrovich/petrovich-eval/)
