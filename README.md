# How to use
Download this project, add template and fill table. 
On table you should mark everything that you will need on your certificate.
### Important!
	First row in every column should be a key, which will be on certificate. 
	This key will take all values in column.

Column "name" will be used as name of final file.

Also on template you should mark:
- ID - this is a place for personal ID of every client
- data - here will be date of generating certificates
